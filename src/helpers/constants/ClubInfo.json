The JW House is a low- to no-cost medical hospitality house for families of patients currently receiving care at Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara and other San Francisco Bay Area hospitals. Cooking always begins with a story. Nicholas’ passion for cooking originates from his experience growing up with a rare endocrine growth disorder called Russell Silver Syndrome (RSS). Children diagnosed with this disorder typically display phenotypes of failure to grow independently and severe lack of appetite. At home, Nicholas was deeply involved in the cooking process as a child, and prepared garlic purees, spice blends, and pasta sauce that created unique aromas, textures, and tastes that sparked curiosity in food. This curiosity in food, and ultimately bonding with cooking, helped Nicholas overcome a lack of appetite previously thought to be genetically encoded.

    "AboutUs": "The Santa Clara University Maker Club is made up of an enthusiastic, diverse group of students with a desire to work with and learn more about the equipment located in the Santa Clara Engineering Maker Laboratory. Students are able to gain the knowledge and training required to use a vast majority of tools including 3D printers, laser cutters, stamp makers, power tools, and more. Students meet in order to collaborate on creative projects and enhance their engineering skills. With the new STEM building opening, we are hoping to expand the Maker Club, and encourage students to harness their own creativity, bringing their projects and ideas to life. Some club activities may include Maker Lab tool certification, t-shirt making, 3D modeling and printing, laser cutting key chains, movie nights, and more! The Maker Club is hoping to get students excited about creating, learning, and teaching to become the innovators of tomorrow.",
